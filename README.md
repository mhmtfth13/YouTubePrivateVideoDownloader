# YouTube Private  Video Downloader
----------
This batch script automates the process of downloading a YouTube video and audio separately, and then merging them into a single video file. It ensures that the required tools (Python, yt-dlp, and FFmpeg) are installed and sets up everything for you.

## Prerequisites

* Python: The script checks if Python is installed. If it's not, the script automatically installs Python for you.
* yt-dlp: This tool is used to download YouTube videos and audio.
* FFmpeg: Required for merging the video and audio files into one file.
Additionally, you will need a cookies.txt file for downloading videos that require authentication or to bypass age restrictions. If you want to take your cookies you can use [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar)
