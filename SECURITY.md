## Security Dependencies

This project relies on several key dependencies that require security attention:

- Python (3.10.6 or later)
- yt-dlp (latest version)
- FFmpeg (latest version)

## Cookie Security

### Cookie File Handling
- Keep your `cookies.txt` file secure and never share it
- Do not commit `cookies.txt` to version control
- Regularly update your cookies file
- Delete cookies.txt after usage if working on shared machines

## Known Security Considerations

### System Access
- The script requires administrator privileges for installation
- Installation modifies system PATH
- Downloads and executes installers from trusted sources:
  - Python from python.org
  - FFmpeg from github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds

### Network Security
- The script downloads files from the internet
- Uses HTTPS for all downloads
- Verifies download sources where possible

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** open a public issue
2. Send a private notification to project maintainers
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline
- Initial Response: 48 hours
- Vulnerability Assessment: 1 week
- Fix Implementation: Dependent on severity
  - Critical: 1-2 weeks
  - High: 2-3 weeks
  - Medium: 1 month
  - Low: Next release cycle

## Security Best Practices for Users
